     * A struct is a value type which means that all information within the struct is allocated at the struct. 
     * Other structs/classes can copy information from a struct, but cannot edit it. This has a positive effect on
     * memory, however the code need to refer when to delete the garbage data.
     * 
     * How I would explain with a comparison, very simplified, classes are servers that is bonded as a web/network, everything
     * refers to each other and values changes all over the network. A struct is more of an database of information or an process that should not change until
     * the user wants/code needs to do so.
     * 
     * Structs are used when the code's instances are small and commonly short-lived or are commonly embedded in other objects
     *
